# -Glass-Detection-Liquid-Level-Classification-


Data
Collection (you must collect your own dataset):


Take
some transparent glasses of water (of different shape & sizes)


Collect
images with at least three types of liquids from a suitable distance


Images
must contain multiple glasses (1 to 3) , empty liquid, 25%-liquid, half liquid,
75% liquid and full liquid


Split
your images into train, validation and test



Data
Labeling:


Label
the data for object detection or image segmentation (for glass location) and 4
class classification ranging from empty to full



AI
model development:


Train
an object detection model (yolov10, yolo11) which should take an image and
return the location and class of each glass in the image


Evaluate
your model on a test/validation set



Inference
GUI:


Create
a demo application for:

Live
Webcam images & Recorded videos
